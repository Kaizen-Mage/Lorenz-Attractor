# Lorenz-Attractor
The Lorenz Attractor is a system of differential equations that exhibits chaotic behavior. It was originally developed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 as a simplified model of atmospheric convection. The system is famous for demonstrating how deterministic systems can exhibit unpredictable and chaotic behavior.

Equations

The Lorenz system is defined by the following three coupled differential equations:





where:

 represents the convective motion of the fluid,

 represents the temperature difference between ascending and descending air currents,

 represents the deviation of the temperature profile from linearity,

 is the Prandtl number,

 is the Rayleigh number,

 is a geometric factor.

Typical parameter values that lead to chaotic behavior are:







Visualization

The Lorenz attractor can be visualized by numerically integrating the system of equations and plotting the trajectory in 3D space. The resulting plot exhibits a butterfly-shaped structure, which is characteristic of chaotic systems.
